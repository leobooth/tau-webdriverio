To run your tests, execute:
$ cd C:\Users\leobo\GitHubRepos\typescript-webdriverio
$ npm run wdio

You can start your test suite by using the run command and pointing to the WebdriverIO config that you just created:
<!-- npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js -->
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts

If you like to run specific test files you can add a --spec parameter:
<!-- npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --spec example.e2e.js -->
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.ts --spec sample-test.e2e.ts

or define suites in your config file and run just the test files defined by in a suite:
npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js --suite exampleSuiteName
